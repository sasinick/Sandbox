A) ARRAYS
    1) Enhancement: Array accepts integer only, can make it generic  
    2) Why moving away from Array:  
        Lookup by value: O(n)  
        Insert: O(n)  
        Delete: O(n)  
    3) Whats the alternative: Use markers like and head and tail and move them around  
        runtime complexity for insertionwill go down to O(1) [ARRAYLIST]  
    4) When to use, when the number of elements to be inserted is known prior  

B) ARRAYLIST
